# Developer Tools

## Design Principles
- **Portability**: Each tool must be a self-contained `.html` file with no external dependencies or build requirements.
- **Theming**: Automatic Light/Dark mode support is required for all tools via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.
- **Consistency**: Styling should be consistent across all tools, using system fonts and a similar aesthetic (clean, modern, card-based layouts where appropriate).
